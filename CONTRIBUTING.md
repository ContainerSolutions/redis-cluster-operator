# Contributing to the Redis Cluster Operator

First off, thank you so much for considering a contribution to the Redis Cluster Operator. 

## What to contribute

This is a classic Open Source project, and as such we welcome all contributions. 

Not only do we welcome code contributions, we also welcome your input, feedback, feature requests, bug reports, and advice.

## Bugs and feature requests

If you find a bug in the operator, please feel free to open an issue and let us know about it. 

Try to include as much detail as possible, so we can replicate the issue and figure out how to fix it.

* Kubernetes version
* Operator version and how it's installed
* RedisCluster CRD you've applied
* Events that have led to the bug
* If possible, also let us know what you have tried so far to fix the issue.

## Feature and Documentation contributions

The issue tracker is where we track all the feature requests as well as bugs which people have found in the operator. 

> Note: We can not accept all pull requests or features contributed. We need to make sure that it makes sense for the 
> wider community, and take into account the long term maintenance that the community will need to support.
> If you are unsure whether something will be accepted, please open an issue, and we'd be happy to discuss it and 
> give early feedback on whether something will get accepted. We would hate for you to spend time working on something 
> that will not be accepted at the end of the day.

If you have ideas for features, but cannot implement them, feel free to open an issue, and we'd be happy to consider 
it as part of our development.

## Pull Request Process

On opening a PR, a GitHub action will execute the test suite against the new code. All code must pass the 
tests, and new code must be accompanied by new tests if possible.

All PRs have to be reviewed and signed off by another developer before being merged to the main branch. This review 
will likely ask for some changes to the code - please don't be alarmed or upset at this; Most PRs will need tweaks 
and is a normal part of the process. It's not personal. We really do appreciate your contribution.

## Development process

See how to develop effectively on the Operator in the [Development Guide](./DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Thanks again for considering a contribution !
